    "content": "Markets/Market Data\nI have a few friends working in Quantitative finance (researcher, dev and trader) who are looking to move to the US because of TC being lower in the UK. I remember seeing a few posts last year which has said France, Germany & Switzerland are gradually sucking away at London’s finance sector.\n\nGiven UK becoming a smaller market, is it likely that the gov may want to regulate finance industry to reduce systemic risk to its economy .\n\nHow do you think UKs quant industry will look like in 10 years time?"

It too is English speaking.\n\nFrom the way I see, London Stock Exchange has antiquated listing rules. The FTSE500 is basically a list of ancient old companies from colonial era.\n\nEssentially, my next question is how important is EU markets for the Quant industry? Is it just agglomeration effect that keeps London in the lead?"

According to the UK’s Met Office, London sees an average of 23.8 inches of rain per year. Paris has an average of 23.6 inches of rain per year, and Amsterdam, which an average of 27.5 inches of rain per year.\n\nThe fog myth dates back to when the city was very polluted. London has amazing pubs and nice places for food and markets. Although I lived in the center, it never feels like a concrete jungle like New York and you hardly realize its a huge and busy city.\n\nThe parks are really nice and you have access to some of the best museums and art galleries.\n\nOf course, not everything is great, but most people really don't complain and some simply love it and wouldn't want to move elsewhere."

I suppose same will happen with people starting in Amsterdam instead of London. It will take a few years but I don’t feel particularly hopeful for London in the Quant space. The only point for London is its international trait, and it also used to be a free market paradise. Now there is Dubai that compete for this sort of thing. I think Brexit definitely won’t make London disappear but for the Quant space in particular, the talent pool provided by the UK alone is simply not good enough for this competitive game. It will be marginally smaller but imo it will become a simple office location as opposed to the home of central operations as it used to be. Shame they voted to leave and we all have to pay the bill now. Full disclosure: I love London as a city, and I’m not going anywhere."
